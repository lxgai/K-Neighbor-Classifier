## About

We are looking at the task of classifying images of digits using k-nearest neighbor classification. Images are converted into vectors of pixel colors and each line of the data files (ASCII text format) contains a feature vector of size 784, followed by its label. This program builds k-nearest neighbor classifiers from the training data.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
